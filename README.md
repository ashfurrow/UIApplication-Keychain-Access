This is a library to abstract access to the keychain on iOS devices. It is a cateogry on UIApplication which must be compiled *without ARC*. If you're using ARC, that's awesome! But to avoid problems with bridging casts with Core Foundation classes, set `-fno-objc-arc` as a [file-specific compiler flag](http://meandmark.com/blog/2011/10/xcode-4-setting-compiler-flags-for-a-single-file). Maybe I'll be less lazy in the future and convert it over. Maybe.
